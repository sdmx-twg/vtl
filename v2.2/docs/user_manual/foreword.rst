Foreword 
========

The Task force for the Validation and Transformation Language (VTL),
created in 2012-2013 under the initiative of the SDMX Secretariat, is
pleased to present the version 2.1 of VTL.

The SDMX Secretariat launched the VTL work at the end of 2012, moving on
from the consideration that SDMX already had a package for
transformations and expressions in its information model, while a
specific implementation language was missing. To make this framework
operational, a standard language for defining validation and
transformation rules (operators, their syntax and semantics) has been adopted.

The VTL task force was set up early in 2013, composed of members of
SDMX, DDI and GSIM communities and the work started in summer 2013. The
intention was to provide a language usable by statisticians to express
logical validation rules and transformations on data, described as
either dimensional tables or unit-record data. The assumption is that
this logical formalization of validation and transformation rules could
be converted into specific programming languages for execution (SAS, R,
Java, SQL, etc.), and would provide at the same time, a “neutral”
business-level expression of the processing taking place, against which
various implementations can be mapped. Experience with existing examples
suggests that this goal would be attainable.

An important point that emerged is that several standards are interested
in such a kind of language. However, each standard operates on its model
artefacts and produces artefacts within the same model (property of
closure). To cope with this, VTL has been built upon a very basic
information model (VTL IM), taking the common parts of GSIM, SDMX and
DDI, mainly using artefacts from GSIM, somewhat simplified and with
some additional detail. In this way, existing standards (GSIM, SDMX,
DDI, others) would be allowed to adopt VTL by mapping their information
model against the VTL IM. Therefore, although a work-product of SDMX,
the VTL language in itself is independent of SDMX and will be usable
with other standards as well. Thanks to the possibility of being mapped
with the basic part of the IM of other standards, the VTL IM also makes
it possible to collect and manage the basic definitions of data
represented in different standards.

For the reason described above, the VTL specifications are designed at
logical level, independently of any other standard, including SDMX. The
VTL specifications, therefore, are self-standing and can be implemented
either on their own or by other standards (including SDMX).

The first public consultation on VTL (version 1.0) was held in 2014.
Many comments were incorporated in the VTL 1.0 version, published in
March 2015. Other suggestions for improving the language, received
afterwards, fed the discussion for building the draft version 1.1, which
contained many new features, was completed in the second half of 2016
and provided for public consultation until the beginning of 2017.

The high number and wide impact of comments and suggestions induced a
high workload on the VTL TF, which agreed to proceed in two steps for
the publication of the final documentation. The first step has been
dedicated to fixing some high-priority features and making them as much
stable as possible; given the high number of changes, it was decided that
the new version should be considered as a major one and thus named VTL 2.0.

The second step, taking also into consideration that some VTL implementation
initiatives are already in place, is aimed at acknowledging and fixing
other features considered of minor impact and priority, without affecting
the features already published or the possible relevant implementations.
In parallel with the work for designing the new VTL version, the task force
has been involved in the SDMX implementation of VTL, aiming at defining
formats for exchanging rules and developing web services to retrieve them;
the new features have been included in the SDMX 3.0 package.

The present VTL 2.1 package contains the general VTL specifications,
independently of the possible implementations of other standards; it includes:

a) The User Manual, highlighting the main
   characteristics of VTL, its core assumptions and the information
   model the language is based on;

b) The Reference Manual, containing the full library of operators ordered 
   by category, including examples;

c) eBNF notation (extended Backus-Naur Form) which is the
   technical notation to be used as a test bed for all the examples;

d) A Technical Notes document, containing some guidelines for VTL implementation.
