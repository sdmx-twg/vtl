.. list-table::

   * - ds1, ..., dsN
     - a minimum of two data set operands
   * - alias
     - | optional aliases for the input data sets, valid only within the “join” operation
       | to make it easier to refer to them. If omitted, the data set name must be used.

       | otherwise it is not kept)
   * - applyExpr
     - | an expression, having the input data sets as operands, which is pairwise applied
       | to all their homonym Measure Components and produces homonym Measure
       | Components in the result; for example if both the data sets *ds1* and *ds2*
       | have the numeric measures *m1* and *m2*, the clause *apply ds1 + ds2* would
       | result in calculating *m1 := ds1#m1 + ds2#m1 and m2 := ds1#m2 + ds2#m2*

Additional Constraints
----------------------
The aliases must be all distinct, and are mandatory for data sets which appear more than once in the Join (self-join)
and for non-named data set obtained as result of a sub-expression.

Let :math:`DS_r` denote a particular join operand called *reference data set*, :math:`C^r := \{\,C^r_i \mid i = 1,\ldots,n^r\,\}`
be the set of all the :math:`n^r` components of the *reference data set* :math:`DS_r`, and
:math:`I^r := \{\,I^r_j \mid I^r_j \in C^r, j = 1,\ldots,m^r,\ m^r \le n^r,\ I^r_j \text{ is an identifier}\,\}` the
subset of :math:`C^r` containing all its :math:`m^r` identifiers.

Let also :math:`DS_{nr_i}` with :math:`\forall i = 1,\ldots,(o-1)`, where :math:`o` is the number of join operands, denote
the i-th non-reference data set, taken in any order, and :math:`I^{nr_i} := \{\,I^{nr_i}_j \mid j = 1,\ldots,m^{nr_i},\ I^{nr_i}_j \text{ is an identifier}\,\}`
the set of its :math:`m^{nr_i}` identifiers :math:`I^{nr_i}_j`.

**inner_join** requires that :math:`\exists\, DS_r \land I^{nr_i} = I^{nr_j},\ \forall i,j = 1,\ldots,(o-1)`,
or, in other words, that the *reference data set* must exist, and all the other, non-reference data sets must have
exactly the same set of Identifiers, which is denoted thereafter by :math:`I^c`. Moreover, exactly one of the
following mutually exclusive conditions must hold: 

* :math:`I^c \subseteq I^r`, or, in other words, the *reference data set* has at least all of the common identifiers in
  :math:`I^c,` among others if any. In this case, the optional `using` clause may be specified to indicate a subset of
  :math:`I^c` to be used as join keys, which must appear in all the data sets (including the *reference data set*). 

* :math:`(I^c \nsubseteq I^r) \land (I^c \subseteq C^r),` or, in other words, the *reference data set* has components
  that match each of the common identifiers in :math:`I^c`, and at least one of these components is not an identifier.
  In this case the `using` clause is mandatory, and it must specify all and only the common identifiers in :math:`I^c`.

The **inner_join** operator must fulfil also other constraints:

* **apply**, **calc** and **aggr** clauses are mutually exclusive
* **keep** and **drop** clauses are mutually exclusive
* `comp` can be only dependent Components (Measures and Attributes, not Identifiers)
* An Identifier not included in the **group by** clause (if any) cannot be included in the **rename** clause
* An Identifier included in the **group except** clause (if any) cannot be included in the **rename** clause. 
  If the **aggr** clause is invoked and the grouping clause is omitted, no Identifier can be included in the **rename** clause
* A dependent Component not included in the **keep** clause (if any) cannot be renamed
* A dependent Component included in the **drop** clause (if any) cannot be renamed

---------
Behaviour
---------
First, the join keys are determined, either implicitly or by the `using` clause, and if the determined keys do not
satisfy the constraints of **inner_join**, an error is raised; then a *relational join* of the input operands is 
performed, by matching the join keys according to SQL inner join (**inner_join**).

The SQL relational join produces an intermediate result, called **virtual data set** (VDS₁); this virtual data set
VDS₁ has the following components:

* The join keys, which appear once and maintain their names, and assume the roles as they appear on the 
  *reference data set*;
* All the left-over identifiers of the *reference data set* which have not been used as join keys;
* The remaining components coming from exactly one input data set, which appear once and maintain their original name
  and role.
* The remaining components coming from multiple data sets, which appear as many times as the data sets they come from;
  names of each of these components are prefixed with the alias of the data set they come from, separated by the 
  “`#`” symbol; in this context, the symbol “`#`” does not denote the membership operator, but acts just as a 
  separator between the data set and the component name. If the aliases are not defined, the names are prefixed with
  the data set name. If the data set name can't be determined (for example the join operand is an expression), an
  error is raised. For example, if “`population`” appears in two input data sets “`ds1`” and “`ds2`”, that have the
  aliases “`a`” and “`b`” respectively, both “`a#population`” and “`b#population`” will appear in the virtual Data
  Set; If the aliases were not specified, the names must be used (i.e. “`ds1#population`” and “`ds2#population`”). 

Then, subsequent clauses in the **inner_join** are procedurally evaluated on the virtual data set VDS₁ as follows.

#. The **filter** is applied on VDS₁, if present, producing the Virtual data set VDS₂. It operates by filtering the
   data points to match a specified boolean expression; when the expression is **true** the Data Point is kept in 
   the result, otherwise it is discarded.
#. Either one of the **apply**, **calc** or **aggr** expressions, if present, are applied on VDS₂ producing VDS₃: 
   
   * **apply** combines the homonym Measures in the source operands whose type is compatible with the
     operators used in `applyExpr`, for each of them generating a single measures. The expression *applyExpr*
     can use as input the names or aliases of the operand data sets. It applies the expression to each of the n-uple
     of homonym Measures in the input data sets producing in the target a single homonym Measure for
     each n-uple. It can be thought of as the multi-measure version of the **calc**. For example, if `d1`, `d2`, 
     and `d3` are data sets with two measures each named `M1` and `M2`, then the expression `d1+d2+d3`, respectively
     sums the values of `M1` and `M2`, so as to obtain in the result: 
     `calc M1 := d1#M1 + d2#M1 + d3#M1, M2 := d1#M2 + d2#M2 + d3#M2`. All the input measures do not appear in VDS₂.
   * **calc** calculates new components by independent sub-expressions evaluated at component level. The role of the 
     new components can be specified, so the original role can be changed if the name is kept the same; if the role
     is not specified, it will be **measure**. Each sub-expression can only reference components in VDS₂, and cannot
     use components generated by other sub-expressions. If a generated component already exists in any of the input
     data sets, all input components homonymous to the former are removed, and only the generated component is kept;
     if any of the removed components were identifiers, an error is raised. Analytic operators can be used in the 
     expressions.
   * **aggr** aggregates values of non-identifier components by indipendent sub-expressions evaluated at component
     level. The role of the components can be specified, so the original role can be changed if the name is kept the
     same; if the role is not specified, it will be **measure**. All non-identifier components are removed, and only
     the components generated by the sub-expressions are kept; if any of the removed components were identifiers,
     an error is raised. The sub-expressions must contain only Aggregate operators, which may specify a grouping 
     clause and/or a filtering expression, as specified in the section for "Aggregation operators". If no grouping
     clause is specified, then all the input Data Points are aggregated in a single group and the clause returns a
     data set that contains a single Data Point and has no Identifier Components.
#. Either a **keep** or **drop** clause, whichever is present, is applied on VDS₃, producing the Virtual data set VDS₄:
   
   * **keep** will maintain all the identifiers and only the specified non-identifier components of VDS₃; 
   * **drop** will remove all specified non-identifier components of VDS₃.
#. The **rename** clause, if present, is applied on VDS₄, producing the Virtual data set VDS₅ by giving each 
   specified component with a new name. If the chosen name already exists in VDS₄, an error is raised.
#. Finally, all components that originally appeared in multiple input data sets, are renamed by stripping their
   previously determined prefix; if this step determines a structure with homonymous components, an error is raised.

The **contents of inner_join** are ideally determined stepwise, by using the *reference data set* as the initial 
partial result, and joining each of the other input data sets to the partial result, starting from the left side
and proceeding towards the right side. In each step, a data point in VDS₁ is generated for each pair of data points
in the partial result and the joined data set in which the common join keys assume the same value. Then, the step is
repeated by joining this partial result to the next data set. 

The **Viral Attribute propagation** in the join is the following. The Attributes explicitly calculated through the **calc**
or **aggr** clauses are maintained unchanged. Other viral attributes, present in exactly one input data set, are also kept
unchanged. For all the other viral attributes, which are present in multiple data sets, the Attribute propagation rule is
applied on VDS₂ (see "Attribute Propagation Rule" section in the User Manual).
