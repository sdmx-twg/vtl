VTL-ML - Join operators
######################################

The Join operators are fundamental VTL operators. They are part of the core of the language and allow to obtain
the behaviour of the majority of the other non-core operators, plus many additional behaviours that cannot be
obtained through the other operators.

The Join operators are four, namely the inner_join, the left_join, the full_join and the cross_join. Because their
syntax is similar, they are described together.
