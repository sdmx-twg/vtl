    stock_to_flow ( ds_1 )

------------------------------------
Semantics  for scalar operations
------------------------------------
This operator does not perform scalar operations.

-----------------------------
Input parameters type
-----------------------------
op ::

    dataset { identifier < time > _ , identifier _* , measure<number> _+ }

-----------------------------
Result type
-----------------------------
result ::

    dataset { identifier < time > _ , identifier _* , measure<number> _+ }

-----------------------------
Additional Constraints
-----------------------------
The operand dataset has an Identifier of type *time*, *date* or *time_period* and may have other Identifiers.

Behaviour
---------

The statistical data that describe the “state” of a phenomenon on a given moment (e.g. resident population on a
given moment) are often referred to as “stock data”.

On the contrary, the statistical data that describe “events” which can happen continuously (e.g. changes in the
resident population, such as births, deaths, immigration, emigration), are often referred to as “flow data”.

This operator takes in input a Data Set of time series which is interpreted as stock data and, for each time series,
calculates the corresponding flow data by subtracting from the measure values of each regular period the
corresponding measure values of the previous one.

The *stock_to_flow* operator can be applied only on Data Sets of time series and returns a Data Set of time series.
The result Data Set has the same Identifier, Measure and Attribute Components as the operand Data Set and
contains the same time series as the operand, because the time series Identifiers (all the Identifiers except the
reference time Identifier) are not changed.

The Attribute propagation rule is not applied.

As mentioned in the section “Behaviour of the Time Operators”, the operator is assumed to know which is the
*time* Identifier as well as the *period* of each time series.
