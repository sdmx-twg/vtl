Additional Constraints

`comp` must be a Data Set Component of the Data Set `ds`.

---------
Behaviour
---------

The membership operator returns a Data Set having the same Identifier Components of `ds` and a single Measure.
If `comp` is a Measure in `ds`, then `comp` is maintained in the result while all other Measures are dropped.
If `comp` is an Identifier or an Attribute Component in `ds`, then all the existing Measures of `ds` are dropped in the
result and a new Measure is added. The Data Pointsâ€™ values for the new Measure are the same as the values of `comp` in `ds`.
A default conventional name is assigned to the new Measure depending on its type: for example `num_var`
if the Measure is `numeric`, `string_var` if it is `string` and so on (the default name can be renamed through
the **rename** operator if needed).
The Attributes follow the Attribute propagation rule as usual (viral Attributes of `ds` are maintained in the result as 
viral, non-viral ones are dropped). If `comp` is an Attribute, it follows the Attribute propagation rule too.
The same symbol denoting the membership operator (**#**) is also used inside other operations at Component level 
(for example in **join**, **calc**, **aggr**) in order to identify the Components to be operated: please note that in these 
cases the symbol **#** does not denote the membership operator (i.e., this operator, which does not operate at 
Component level), but a special keyword of the syntax of the other operator in which it is used.
